# Recharge Simplify

The application was designed for the efficient management of customer recharge details for rural shopkeepers, from a lengthy and error-prone process to date. The app is designed to reduce manual effort and streamline recharge tracking, thus automating reminders that may sometimes overwhelm small village shopkeepers, handling multiple families, and complex payment systems.

- **Why Recharge Simplify?**
In rural villages, shopkeepers would handle all recharge transactions for customers by keeping track of details such as expiration dates, who made the recharge, and payment responsibility. All this is not only time consuming but also riddled with a lot of room for error; especially with the "paise baki" or "khata" system, local to the settlements, where people settle their monthly payments.

Recharge Management System was designed for:

Simplify Transaction Tracking: Shopkeepers had to handle large numbers of recharges and customers, leading to confusion about who made a recharge and who is responsible for payment. The system centralizes this information, thus reducing errors.

Track Family-Based Payments: As payments are typically handled by the Head of Family (HOF), the app organizes family relationships to clearly identify the payment responsibilities for each HOF.

Automated Payment Reminders- Sending an automated WhatsApp reminder some days before the recharge date is due to approach can help avoid the effort of manual reminders and missed payments..



## Key Features
- **Family Tree System:**
The application will allow shopkeepers to create and manage family trees, linking members of the family to the Head of Family (HOF) for each transaction. This ensures that the person responsible for making the payment can be identified even when there are common names between families.

- **Tracking Recharge Details:**
Shopkeepers will be able to view each recharge date and pack duration along with payment status. The app sends reminders on WhatsApp messages in case the recharge is close to expiring, and there would be no missed payments.

- **"Baki" or "Khata" System:**
Keeping the local "paise baki" or "khata" in mind, whereby payments are typically settled at month-end, the application maintains a family-specific transaction history so that the shopkeeper doesn't miss the payment and balances are easily tracked.

- **Reminder System:** 
WhatsApp-based automatic reminders to the customer about when their recharges are due; this minimizes manual follow-up efforts and increases payment collection efficiency

- **Efficiency and Scalability:**
Recharge management time got reduced by 12-20 minutes per week, and with the same level of workload, shopkeepers can take care of 20%-30% more families on board, considerably improving operational efficiency and scalability..
